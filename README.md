# Heron

## Setup

Please consult setup.txt for a list of setup instructions. Currently it is not executable but it contains the steps I took to set up my environment. All executable scripts are contained in /heron and should run when standing in the top level of the repo via the usual 'python ./heron/script.py' call from the terminal.

## Solution

For a detailed description of the problem statement as well as my solution please consult *tutorial.ipynb.*
